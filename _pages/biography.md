I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh and brought up in Saudi Arabia because my father worked there. I was so fascinated with computer since childhood than my mother scolded me often for me spending plenty of time on computers. I went ahead and finish my bachelor degree from American International University-Bangladesh. My interest on research grew when was in graduate studies. 
I then became fascinated Artificial Intelligence, particularly with neural networks how they tend to replicate the human brain. My previous post-graduation research I analyzed how a system that will classify emotions more accurately and efficiently than existing systems. I published paper headlined “A literature Review on Emotion Recognition Using Various Methods” in the Global Journal of Computer Science and Technology.  
My master’s thesis topic at the University of South Dakota was Feature Extraction and Matching to analyze lung symmetry for pulmonary abnormality detection. I participated in a poster session and a presentation session showing my research progress in Data Science Symposium hosted by South Dakota State University. I also provided a small talk about the progress and scope of deep learning tools on satellite imaging for disaster management. I was awarded a Graduate Research and Creative Scholarship Grant in Fall 2019 after submitting my research proposal. I have worked on a NSF funded project in Wayne State University named cancer detection and classification from histopathological data as a research assistant.  
I want to see myself working on innovative research projects on my Ph.D. with dedication and passion. Which will ultimately guide me to the opportunities in academia and industries where I can utilize my research scopes to improve the state-of-the-art. I want to contribute with my skill and experience for improving and facilitating the research to the welfare of science and humankind.
