Some of my current projects :
============================
* **Deep Learning for Colored Handwritted Digit Recognition.**
* **Deep Feature Extraction to analyze lung symmetry for pulmonary abnormality detection:** Analysis and comparison of image processing and deep learning models of feature extraction and matching to detect similarities within both lungs for diseases.
* **Cancer classification on nuclei features from histopathological images:** Extracting features of the nuclei from the TCGA dataset and analyzing the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the dataset.
